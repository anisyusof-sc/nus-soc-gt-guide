## Fees Subsidy

All full time NUS staff (including Graduate Tutors) are eligible for full fees subsidy (excluding misc. fees). However, we need to apply for the subsidy manually. Any late or incomplete subsidy application are subjected to late fees. Here are the steps.

1. Navigate to the [Staff Portal](https://staffportal.nus.edu.sg/)
2. Go to Staff Handbook > More... > Staff Concessions for Continuing Education > Government-subsidized graduate programs
3. This will download the pdf titled GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GRADUATE PROGRAMMES
4. Follow the instructions in the pdf. You will need to fill in a form and it will take some time for the application to process. Alternatively, there is an email in the pdf that you may contact.

Note: Please apply for the subsidy as soon as you can. The duration application varies, and may take a few weeks for it to be approved. This may delay the fees payment, and may be subjected to late fees.

Note: If subsidy have not been approved yet and the deadline of school fees payment is nearby, you have to pay the sum upfront. The amount paid will be reimbursed later when the subsidy is approved, but it will take some time (e.g., by end of semester). So it is better to get the subsidy approved well before hand, so that it is reflected in the school bills before the deadline.
