## Teaching Relief
Graduate tutors are allowed to apply for teaching relief for a semester. Teaching relief is generally taken during the qualifying exam semester, but it is up to you which semester that you would like to take. Here are the steps. Please apply well in advance (e.g., before the semester begins) so that they can coordinate the teaching staff accordingly.

1. Get in touch with a staff from Graduate Studies via email. You should be able to find someone in the School of Computing's [Staff Directory](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/about/directory/)

2. Include the following information in the email and cc the GT teaching coordinator for CS or IS respectively.
    - State which semester of teaching relief you would like to apply (e.g., AY21/22 Semester 2)
    - State briefly why do you need to apply teaching relief
    - State briefly your research area/topic
    - State your advisor's name

3. The Graduate Studies Office will take some time to verify and approve. They will probably contact the teaching coordinator(s) and/or advisor to confirm your teaching relief application.

4. Once the Graduate Studies has approved your application, please inform your GT teaching coordinator. If you have already been assigned a module to teach in the upcoming semester, please notify that module's coordinator immediately that your teaching relief has been approved so that they can reorganize the teaching assistants well in time.
