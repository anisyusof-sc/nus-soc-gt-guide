## Travel Claim

Full-time MSc/PhD students are eligible to apply for a travel grant for the purpose of attending overseas conferences using the **Postgraduate Travel Grant Application Form**. As we are part-time students, we cannot apply using this form. Instead, we have to go through the process in [**Concur**][id].

The claim process can be broken down into two steps.

In the first step, a travel request has to be submitted and approved by the Head of Department (HoD). This can be done either pre-trip or post-trip. As I submitted my request after the trip, I will only talk about post-trip. Do note that the process for pre-trip could be very different. The supporting documents required for post-trip claims are：

1. Acceptance notification and reviewers’ comments
2. Accepted paper
3. Airfare receipts by the most economical and direct route
4. Registration fees details from the conference website and receipt
5. Accommodation receipts 

After the HoD has approved the travel request, an expense report has to be attached to the travel request for the finance department to process the claim. The expense report should reflect what has been stated in the travel request. The supporting documents for the expense report are largely similar to the travel request, with the addition of **Price Breaker** quotation to show that the airfare was indeed from the most economical and direct route. It must be of **the same airline, the same route and the same day of the week**.

Good Luck for your publications.
