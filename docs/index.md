# Welcome
This is an unofficial guide intended for graduate tutors in [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), National University of Singapore. The guide is driven by GTs, with the hope to provide useful guidelines to current and future GTs.

Feel free to join our WhatsApp group. You may need to ask one of the existing GTs to add you in. We also have an official mailing list for CS and IS, respectively.
